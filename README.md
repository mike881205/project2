# Come On Guys

### This app is a work in progress

Ever had a day off and wished you knew which of your friends was also off on the same day without have to shoot out 100 texts and wait for a reply!?! And then after all that trouble having to figure out what you're going to actually do!

  - You and your friends register as new users
  - Everybody selects their availibility
  - The application will automatically compare schedules and tell you and your friends when you have the same days off.

## What is left to be done?

  - Complete the functionality allowing for users' schedules to be compared and displayed to each other. 
  - Minor bug fixes


## Tools Used
* **moment.js** -to show and update your weekly scheduled on/off days
* **axios** -for pulling data from the api to append to the HTML
* **MYSQL** -database to hold the users info and availability
* **sequelize** -eliminated the need for repetitive SQL code

### LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE...
* Adding preferences to certain events you would like to do
* Mulitple groups of friends to share schedule with
